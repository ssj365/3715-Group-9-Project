Our application is a university website that can be used by multiple students. Some of the main features include:

1. Students can add or drop courses (both the student and Course pages support this functionality)
2. Courses can be added or deleted, and a persistent history of deleted courses can be viewed  (Previous Courses page)
3. Directions to campus are available (on the Directions page) and are calculated based on current location
4. A login screen so that many students can access the website to add/drop their courses and review their registered courses (registered courses can be viewed both on student andCourse page)

Our website can be viewed on many devices, including mobile, and information (i.e. course addition or deletion) is persistent throughout the application.
